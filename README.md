2. **Interests and Values**:
    
    - Key interests related to my career:
        - Working in a team.
        - Having a career pathway.
        - Tackling hard problems.
        - Learning new things and pushing the boundaries of my abilities.
        - Creating things of value, of real use to people to improve their lives, and furthering the growth of humanity to the stars!
        - Using existing technology in novel ways.
        

    - Values important to me in a work environment:
        
        - Honesty and transperancy. Better decisions are possible with clear information.
        - Creative experimentation. Sometimes a certain thread of logic does indeed lead to a dead end or slows things down - innovation, divergent thinking and trying new things is crucial to breaking out of stagnation.
        - Cooperative teamwork. I myself am deeply competitive, but I don't focus that against my co-workers - I turn that instinct outward against the problems we face or a competitor company to beat.
        - Growth leadership. I believe the best leaders are the ones invested in the success of their subordinates. This goes both ways - receiving support from above, and being available to my juniors. Recognizing people's abilities and experience regardless of their official role is crucial to unlocking their value for the team.
        - Autonomy. The people working "boots on the ground" are the ones with the best sense of what's going on - providing them resources and freedom to tackle problems without too much constraint from above reduces the time and cost of solving "local" problems.
        - Resilience, both technical and emotional. Difficult problems require a ton of grit to see through and keeping at it even when things seem hopeless. Understanding that criticism of one's work or methods is not personal (but can _feel_ that way) and absorbing feedback is key in growing as a professional.

**Long-term Goals:**
    
My primary trait is Extroversion - I love people. A very close second is my love for learning new things of a technical nature and implementing it - a combonation of my high openess, conscientiousness and competitiveness. Winning (meaning, hitting that goal and excelling at it) is a great driver of mine. The harder the goal, the greater the payoff.      
My ideal career would be one inside a medium to large company working on the bleeding edge of technology, where collaboration is key. I don't mind working with disagreeable people or in tough environments - in fact I prefer it. High stakes and fast pace for me please. But (often) the drawback of large established companies is beaurocracy, which I don't deal well with. I require a degree of autonomy to experiment.   
Working inside a small startup would be a good fit too, provided the individuals are highly motivated, organized and communicates well. When there is a lack of social leadership, I tend to step up and take charge - not because I _want_ to be in charge (it is a burden) but because I realize the ship will drift off if there's no captain at the helm. This can step on the toes of the "official leaders" (especially if they tend to be authoritarian) creating friction in the social sphere.   
I get on well with Libertarian types which most creative people tend to be, unless they're exceptionally cynical or highly unconscientious. My high level of conscientiousness means I'm a hard worker, and keep my word, but I'm also extremely judgemental (most markedly toward myself) and I can come across as insulting when simply wanting to point out the deficiency of a particular thing - having high standards comes at great emotional cost.  
This is atleast somewhat offset by my high degree of compassion - I'm geniunely invested in people and nothing makes me happier than seeing others overcome obstacles and succeeding. On the other hand, I don't believe in making things "soft and easy", because life isn't that way. So it comes as a double-edged sword - I care about you, but I'm going to tell you all the things you don't want to hear, but need to hear.

I believe a highly technically challenging career will suit me well, and **my aim is to progress to a leadership position.** I will need to start at a Junior position as a Fullstack, or Backend developer to learn. From there I intend to work my way up from a technical implementer to a technical manager, such as a Product Manager or Software Architect. Being both client facing and managing a team would be ideal - I translate well between technical and lay people. Furthermore, I am commited to seeing a client's goals realized, and at the same time, can clearly communicate realistic expectations. And most importantly, having my team's back. Providing resources (meaning, fighting for it if necessary) and guidance is deeply satisfying to me.

Seeing as I need to start small, and have much to learn, I envision my transition from Junior to Senior within 2 years of finding employment. This may be a misguided guess, and I'll only be able to have a realistic idea once within the industry. At the end of 5-8 years I'd ideally be a Senior Dev starting to move into management.

### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:
    
    - Continue on current course of learning with CodeSpace and Udemy. Although CodeSpace is a priority, set time aside for Udemy courses on calendar.  
    +-2 hours a week for Security course on Udemy.
    - Deepen my knowledge of psycology, and seek out materials that deal with interpersonal conflict specifically. Read the 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene to better understand the darker side of social interactions.  
    Read 1 chapter a week.
    - Ask for feedback from peers and seniors about how I come across in critical and professional situations. Restrict to trusted people.  
    As the opportunity presents itself.
    - Practice a typing daily on one of the many free websites available.  
    +-15-20 minutes a day.
    - Polish online presence on GitHub, Linkedin and personal webpage.   
    Complete CDV from CodeSpace to get started.
    - Keep an eye on job opportunities, and apply for relevant positions.  
    Opt-in to job notifications from Linkedin today.
    - Build my reputation with the software community and get exposure to real world products. Do this by finding an open source project to commit time to. For now this will have to be on hold until my schedule becomes lighter.


2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
    
    - Dive deep into the tech community, find events and socials near me, or even online in which I can participate, contribute and network. Ideally I'd like to take on a role within the community after getting stablized in my career.
    - I plan to join a toastmasters organization once things are little more settled and my schedule a little more freed up after finding a stable job and settling into my local community.
    - Never shy away from an opportunity to teach, or help whenever the opportunity presents itself.
    - Continue to expand programming language skillset, especially those used by critical systems, such as C, C++ and Rust. Not an immediate priority, because my work does not explicitly need it right now, but over the next 3-4 years.
    - Carry as much responsibility as I can muster in my work place, and be prepared to go the extra mile in terms of communication and being a resource to my colleagues and clients. This will refine my ability to work with people effectively.
    - Continue to pursue learning of "hard" materials - I've been able to understand programming a great deal better the deeper I get into the fundamentals, such as OS design, electronics etc. and reading articles by the great innovaters in Computer Science such as Ken Thompson. In the future, I'd like to subscribe to a reputable CS journal to get access and first exposure to the bleeding edge of CS research.
    - Work my butt off and get used to hard work for long hours and how to deal with a demanding schedule.
    - Continue my learning of psycology and introspection into human nature. I plan to obtain a psycology degree (and maybe even a clinical licence) over the next 20 years.

### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:

    | Challenge                                      | Strategy                                                                                                                                                                        |
    |------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Job Market takes a  dive, obsolete skills.     | Continually expand skillset into multiple domains  and focus on learning "eternal fundamentals" -  avoid becoming a "cargo-cult" programmer.                                    |
    | Little to no social  events hosted in my area. | Utilize the power of the internet to  connect to motivated people across the globe.                                                                                             |
    | Time commitments to  other responsibilities.   | Use a calendar to schedule time for  goal progress; set clear boundaries, refuse nonsense.                                                                                      |
    | Unexpected life events.                        | Do not over-schedule -> it's impossible to account  for every minute of one's life. Leave room for flexibility.                                                                  |
    | Burnout; difficult work environment.           | Schedule time for hobbies, and family (a calendar  isn't just for work). Negotiate a fair trade of my  time and effort, and have a backup in place if  negotiations break down. |
    ---


2. **Opportunities for Growth**:
